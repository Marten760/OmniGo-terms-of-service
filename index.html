        <h2 id="acceptance">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using the OmniGo application ("Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to all of these Terms, do not use the Service. These Terms apply to all users, including customers and store owners. These terms may also be subject to additional terms and conditions specific to your region. By using the Service, you confirm that you are legally eligible to be bound by these Terms.</p>

        <h2 id="accounts">2. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>To use the full features of our Service, you must create an account. We offer two types of access:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pi Account Login:</strong> By logging in with your Pi Network account, you can make payments using Pi coins. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Pi account.</li>
          <li><strong>Guest Mode:</strong> You can browse stores and products as a guest. However, you will not be able to place orders or make payments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account. You are responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The accuracy and timeliness of the information you provide.</li>
          <li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and any passwords.</li>
          <li>Notifying us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</li>
          <li>You are fully responsible for any activity that occurs under your account.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="services">3. Our Services</h2>
        <p>OmniGo provides a platform that connects users with local stores ("Stores") to order products and services. You expressly understand and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>OmniGo acts as a technical intermediary between you and independent stores. We do not own, operate, or control the quality, safety, or legality of any products offered, or the accuracy of store listings.</li>
          <li>Any contractual relationship regarding the sale or delivery of products is established directly between you and the store only. We are not a party to those transactions.</li>
          <li>We do not verify the identity of all users or the accuracy of their information. We rely on the accuracy of the information provided by users and store owners.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="payments">4. Payments and Transactions</h2>
        <p>All payments for orders are processed through the Pi Network. By placing an order, you authorize the transaction through the Pi SDK. OmniGo does not store your private wallet keys or secret phrases. We only record transaction details (ID, amount, status) for order fulfillment and support. In addition to the product price, you may be subject to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Delivery Fee:</strong> Determined independently by the stores and displayed upon request.</li>
          <li><strong>Taxes:</strong> You are responsible for any applicable taxes associated with your transactions.</li>
          <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Subject to each store's refund policy. We assist in facilitation, but the final decision rests with the store.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="user-conduct">5. User Conduct</h2>
        <p>You agree not to use the Service to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Violate any laws or regulations.</li>
          <li>Post false, inaccurate, or misleading information (including in reviews).</li>
          <li>Engage in fraudulent activities.</li>
          <li>Interfere with the operation of the Service or any user's enjoyment of it, including impersonating any person or entity.</li>
          <li>Collect or store personal information about other users.</li>
          <li>Use any automated software or means to extract data or monitor the Service.</li>
          <li>Interfere with or disrupt the security of the Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="store-owners">6. Store Owner Responsibilities</h2>

          <li><strong>Listing Accuracy:</strong> Provide accurate and substantive descriptions of products, including prices and images that reflect the actual product. Any misrepresentation may result in the cancellation of your store.</li>
          <li><strong>Order Fulfillment:</strong> You are legally obligated to complete any order accepted through our platform, unless there is a clear error in pricing or product description.</li>
          <li><strong>Customer Service and Refunds:</strong> You are primarily responsible for your customer service and for processing their complaints and refund requests. You must have a clear refund policy.</li>
          <li><strong>Taxes:</strong> You are solely responsible for calculating and remitting any taxes related to your sales.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="termination">7. Termination</h2>
        <p>You may terminate your use of the Service at any time by deactivating your account. We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have violated these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease.</p>

        <h2 id="disclaimers">8. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. UNEXPRESS MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICE OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, OR MATERIALS INCLUDED THEREIN. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE.

        <p>The interpretation and governance of these Terms shall be subject to the laws of [Your Country/State].

        <h2 id="general-provisions">13. General Provisions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, that provision will be severed or interpreted to reflect the original intention, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</li>
          <li>Our failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms does not waive that right or provision.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="pi-network-relation">14. Relationship with Pi Network</h2>
        <p>OmniGo is an independent application built on the Pi Network platform. We are not operated by, nor are we partners with, the Pi Core Team.
